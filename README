NAME
    RT::Extension::Captcha - solve a CAPTCHA before some actions in RT

DESCRIPTION
    This extension is for RT 4.2 or newer. It requires solving captchas when
    a user creates a ticket (using either regular interface or quick create)
    and on replies/comments (updates).

INSTALLATION
    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make install
        May need root permissions

    Edit your /opt/rt4/etc/RT_SiteConfig.pm
        Add this line:

            Plugin('RT::Extension::Captcha');

    Clear your mason cache
            rm -rf /opt/rt4/var/mason_data/obj

    Restart your webserver

CONFIGURATION
  No CAPTCHA rights
    Users who have right 'NoCaptchaOnCreate' or 'NoCaptchaOnUpdate' will see
    no captchas on corresponding actions.

  Font
    As GD's builtin font is kinda small. A ttf font is used instead. By
    default font defined by ChartFont option (RT's option to set fonts for
    charts) is used for CAPTCHA images.

    As well, you can set font for cpatchas only using "%Captcha option"
    described below.

  %Captcha option
    See etc/Captcha_Config.pm for defaults and example. %Captcha option is a
    hash. Now, only ImageProperties key has meaning:

        Set(%Captcha,
            ImageProperties => {
                option => value,
                option => value,
                ...
            },
        );

    ImageProperties are passed into "new" in GD::SecurityImage. Read
    documentation for the module for full list of options.
